## automerge-paper.json.gz

This data set is copied from the automerge-perf repository, prepared by Martin Kleppmann. It contains the editing trace from writing this LaTeX paper. The trace contains 182,315 inserts and 77,463 deletes.

Due to the editor in which the paper was written, each txn contains exactly 1 patch, which is either a single character insert or single character delete. Also there are no timestamps, so it looks like every edit happened at the same moment.
